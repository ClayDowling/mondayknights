---

Alice was getting a couple of dogs and a cup of coffee in an all night Coney
when she saw the trouble come in.

Jimmy was getting a coffee to calm his nerves after he'd just boosted a '69
Trans Am convertible for Shelby, the God of Speed, from the private showroom of
Rodney Strange, leader of an apostate speed cult.  The trouble that came
through the door: six followers of Strange, wanting their sacred relic back.


## The Good

The car was successfully recovered, after a high speed chase involving three
mustangs to resanctify the vehicle.  With the help of Dagmar, the car was
delivered to Shelby's garage in Allen Park.

## The Ugly

When Jimmy dropped Alice off to retrieve her truck, it was surrounded by police, and a man was pinned to this hood with a very long knife.  Jimmy drove her away to find a safe place to spend the night.

## Experience

15 points earned by both Alice and Jimmie.
