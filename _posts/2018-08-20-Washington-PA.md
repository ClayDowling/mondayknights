**Lily, what drew you to government service?  It's kind of an unusual career choice for a felinoid.**

I liked the benefits package, and the lack of questions about the catnip.  This is a place that gaurantees a job, no matter who you are.  If you do the job, you'll get paid.  Not just everyone will hire a felinoid.  Apparently folks don't think a felinoid can lift 40 pounds, and it's just in every job application.  Also, I kept getting fired from gardening jobs, because I wasn't supposed to be digging up as many plants as I thought I was.

**Adrienne, what drew you to the Unsinkable II?**

I grew up in Boston, to an upper class family.  I was the youngest of five, the black sheep.  I liked the alure of freedom in the sky.  Kind of go do something different, just to do something different.  As well as the hobby, the tinkering, the family wasn't super into, so that was part of the appeal.

**Amos, how do you find the regimented life of government service, compared to the comparative freedom of life on the frontier?**

Well, you know, I get to travel a lot, on the government bill, and I get good drinks.  I don't have to stay in one place.  That engine stuff, that's good.  But yeah, sometimes followin' orders is a pain.  I miss being able to go out into the wilderness and get lost for weeks.  It pays for the booze.

## Summary of Action

The crew was tasked by President Andrew Jackson to recover the Declaration of Independence, stolen from the Library of Congress by [Gentry Lee]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _world/gentry-lee.md %}) and his band of ruffians.  He was seen heading towards Indian Country.

The most likely path was to the air port at Washington, Pennsylvania, for which the Unsinkable II set off.

Upon arriving the crew learned the following:
 - Lee took on more supplies than could be comfortably carried by a vessel of that size with that crew.
 - The crew of five raised merry hell in Washington PA.
 - Their ship's name is Chatelain.  It is yellow with purple scrollwork.
 - Good Boys aren't afraid of felinoids.
 - Adrienne is well dressed even when visiting low dives.
 - Amos is a BAMF in a bar fight.

## Experience

Five points for all.

An additional point to Lilly for successfully making a Control Roll vs their Cynophobia.

All points have been added to sheets already.
