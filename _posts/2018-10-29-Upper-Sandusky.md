title: "Upper Sandusky"

The crew of the *Unsinkable II* arrived to find *La Chatelaine* already landed.  At some point in the flight Amos's dog commited an unforgivable indisgression in Lilly's cabin.  The felinoid departed over the side amid a flurry of hurled bedding, duffle packing, and bad language.

Adrienne and Amos took the opportunity to do a little reconnaisance, and learned that Gentry Le was waiting in a bar for parts of his crew, who had been taking an overland journey, to arrive.  That gave them a window of opportunity to sneak onto his ship and look for the stolen goods.

The crew was strangly absent from the upper decks, so Amos and Adrienne picked the locks on the captain's cabin and started exploring.  They discovered a safe well set into the frame of the ship.  Attempts to crack the lock were unsuccessful.  The previously missed crew was found, however, coming up onto the deck and terribly inquisitive about who was making the noise in the captain's cabin.

Not wanting to explain what they were doing in the captain's cabin, the Amos and Adrienne fled out the stern lights and bolted for safety.  Amos stuck the landing perfectly, but quickly lost his footing on treacherous ground while trying to run.  Adrienne, while less graceful in her exit, made a clean getaway.

As this drama was unfolding, Olivia, on special dispatch from the President, arrived to see people fleeing the ship she was told to intercept.  Reasoning that these were probably members of the crew she was supposed to be joining, she managed to trip one of the pursuers and take him prisoner.

The *Chatelaine's* caught up with Amos and Adrienne, and there was much posturing and bravado.  Olivia's knife-based choke hold of the captured crew member seemed to tip the scales, but the wanted interrogation was forestalled when it was realized that her prisoner wasn't a crew member, but a rent boy.  This not only explained the crew's absence from the upper decks, but also, with a critical success by Adrienne, made them willing to reveal that Lee would be meeting a business associate at *The Palace,* a high end establishment in the Capitol which catered to all of the vices.

The crew assembled in The Palace. Gentry Lee was sitting with a small framed, olive skinned wyandotte woman.  A well dressed man servant came to the table, a disagreement of some variety ensued, and then the servant left.

Olivia followed the servant to the Huron hotel.  After bluffing her way past a dish washer in the kitchen, she forced her way into the servant's room.  A critical success on intimidation convinced the servant, Wilkins, to spill everything he knew.  His employer, George Lawrence, is a loyal servant of King George and wants to buy the stolen Declaration.  Owing to personal complications related to a young lady and the three Nadawa brothers, he has been forced to leave town and head for Detroit, where he has asked to meet Lee.

In an effort to get better cooperation from Wilkins, Adrienne and Amos undertook to find Cynthia and convince her to run with Wilkins.  Wilkins and Cynthia have agreed to come with the Unsinkable II to Detroit.
