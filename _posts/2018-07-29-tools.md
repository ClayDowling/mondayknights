## Software

Because GURPS characters can be computation-intensive, I strongly recommend
that everyone use character creation software.  The best cross-platform tool I
am aware of is [GURPS Character Sheet](http://gurpscharactersheet.com/).  It
will manage all of the necessary calculations for you.

If you wish to spend a small amount of money, and have a Windows computer,
there is also [GURPS Character
Assistant](http://www.sjgames.com/gurps/characterassistant/) which will produce
output idential to the official character sheets.  I strongly recommend against
putting this on client computers.

## Storage

To eliminate the problem of keeping track of how up to date your current
character sheet is, I'd also like to see characters stored in the [Monday
Knights](https://github.com/ClayDowling/mondayknights) git repo.  If you aren't a collaborator yet, send your GitHub id to [clay@lazarusid.com](mailto:clay@lazarusid.com), or ping me on slack.

The only things necessary to store are the raw `.gcs` file and your character
portrait.  At some point on game day I'll declare a release freeze, then
produce the PDF character sheets as a
[release](https://github.com/ClayDowling/mondayknights/releases).  While you're
still able to update the character right until we start play, this release
version is the one I'll be looking at, and you'll probably have to keep
reminding me of updated features.
