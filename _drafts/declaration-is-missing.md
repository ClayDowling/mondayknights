title: "The Declaration of Independence is Missing"
---

Starting from Philadelphia, team will be notified by the President's confidential secretary that their country needs them.  Gentrey Lee, an adventurer, has stolen the Declaration of Independence from the Library of Congress.  He and his band of professional scoundrels were last seen heading west, towards Indian Territory.

# Washington, PA

It will take three days to reach Washington, PA via airship.  This is the last good place to resupply before entering Indian Territory.  Here they can confirm that Lee came this way, and that he lay in light supplies.  This would generally be enough to take him to Sandusky with a comfortable margin.
