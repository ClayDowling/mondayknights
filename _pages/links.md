### Game Materials

- [GURPS Core Rules](http://www.sjgames.com/gurps/books/Basic/).  You
  absolutely do not need to own either of these books.  I will help you make
  the kind of characters you want to make, and guide you through the rules used
  during play.  But some folks like to have the rules handy.

- [Steam-Tech](http://www.sjgames.com/gurps/books/steamtech/) Not definitive
  for our world, but we'll probably pull a lot of inspiration from here.
  Gadgeteers and mechanics might want to be familiar with this kind of stuff.

- [GURPS Thaumatology: Ritual Path
  Magic](http://www.sjgames.com/gurps/books/ritualpathmagic/) if anybody is
  interested in using magic, this is the magic system most appropriate to
  Victorian era magic.  Lots of arcane rituals and the ability to bind magic
  into objects.  Again, you do not need this book, but it will be very helpful.

## Tools

- [GURPS Character Sheet](http://www.sjgames.com/gurps/books/ritualpathmagic/)
  for maintaining your character as play progresses.

- [Monday Knights Git Repo](https://github.com/ClayDowling/mondayknights).
  Characters will be stored there.  If you have your own game content to add,
  it also goes here.
