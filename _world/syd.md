He tells her that he is a type of addiction counselor.  He doesn't have an
office, he makes house calls.  He wants to see her in her home to see how
she's doing.  He'll help her stay clean, but in exchange he needs to tell
her about the struggles of her recovery, and how she's addressing her past
life.

Unknown to Syd, it's Drennozeth's power that is keeping her clean.  It also
fuels rages that cause her to go on bloody rampages against the people who
she feels hurt her.  As she goes on she has less control and it takes less
to trigger a rage.

*Motivation:* Revenge against those who wronged her, both actually and just in
her mind.

*How Is It Motivating Now:* She'll start with her pimp, and work her way
through some memorable johns, and then some imaginary ones.

*What Did She Get For Her Soul:* She has very high strength, Hard to Kill,
High Pain Tolerance and Combat Reflexes.  She's also got a couple of switch
blades and a proclevity for using ice picks in particularly uncomfortable
places.
