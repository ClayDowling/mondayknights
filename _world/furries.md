title: "Furry Members of Our World"

There's been some speculation about the characters being non-human.  Some of the proposed types include anthropomorphic animals.  These are some proposed types that we could use.

## Morreaus

The result of successful experiments by Dr. Morreau, these are chimeras which combine properties of both humans and animals.  While his initial experiments used only advanced surgical techniques to grant the power of speech, later experiments created true chimeras which combined the genetic material of the two species.  This produced sentient beings who could pass their traits on to offspring.

### Game Terms
The template for a Morreau will include a list of advantages and disadvantages which the player will select from to build their character.

## Viera

While humans were minding their own business on the Asian side of the Beiring Strait, rabbits on the North American prairie were evolving into an intelligent species with the power of speech.

When humans crossed the Beiring land bridge, they established themselves in this new place.  When they reached the prairies, they found another intelligent species there ahead of them.  After some initial conflict, the two species established a peaceful relationship, predicated on the basis that anything that can survive on the prairie will mess you up.

### Game Terms

The template for a Viera will include a fixed list of advantages and disadvantages that are applied to the character.

## Racial Templates

In GURPS terms, a racial template is a set of advantages and disadvantages which are included in a character during character creation.  Typically a racial template has a net neutral effect on a characters' point totals.
