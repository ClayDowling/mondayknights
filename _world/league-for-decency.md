title: "League for Decency"
---
Moral crusaders for decency, the group opposes vice in all its forms.  Their public face is strongly worded letters to the editor, somewhat strident blog posts, and the occasional protest march.  They are fairly closely affiliated with the Million Mom March, and there are a lot of members shared in common.

Behind the scenes, there is a dedicated core whose philosophy is closer to "By Any Means Necessary."  The members are generally not physically intimidating, but they are very good at organization and logistics.  They have an army of mini vans and SUVs, a killer phone tree, and a tendency to be in awkward places with cameras uploading to the cloud.

They have burnt down the occasional drug house, but they're more likely to blackmail people filmed soliciting prostitution.  This also means that they have good political cover, because they have dirt on people in useful places.
