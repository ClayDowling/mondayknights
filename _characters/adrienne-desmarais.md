- **Husband:** Cabhan O'Connor

## Background
Grew up in Boston, upper-class, second gen. Youngest of five, family is big in the rum industry.

Her eldest brother got into machinery manufacturing, and Adrienne spent a lot of time at the factory, tinkering with gadgets on her own time. The more her family frowned on her hobby, unbecoming of a young woman, the more tightly she clung to it.

By 27, Adrienne's family was despairing of her ever marrying. She met a Cabhan O'Connor, and they had a daughter together (Etienne, now age 8). Family was much aghast, very scandal. Neither Adrienne's nor Cabhan's (very Irish Catholic) family was terribly supportive of the situation, though Adrienne's brother gave Cabhan a job at the factory, where he still works.

Adrienne, meanwhile, secured a sweet gig doing airship repairs for the government. She became pilot of the Unsinkable II about four years ago. During this time, she did finally marry Cabhan in a small ceremony. She didn't make her marriage terribly public and still goes by "Captain Desmarais," especially at work.

She has come to enjoy her work, and she loves the freedom of the sky. While she is estranged from her parents, she sees her brother, husband, and daughter as often as she can. She regrets missing so much of her daughter's formative years and hopes to make it up to her later in life.

### The Unsinkable II
- Nigh unsinkable. Nigh.
- Pretty unremarkable, smallish boat. Can carry three days' fuel onboard.

## Diary
### 8/20
Washington, PA has airfields on the northern edge. Bordering Indian country, Algonquian spoken. Need to stock up on fuel to get over mountains.

Got some information about Lee Gentry in Washington. Fueled up and met back up with Amos; still need to find Lily. If there are dead birds on the ship, will not be pleased.

### Balloon Ships
Canoe-light, light wooden frame. Confederacy birds used as scouts. Dogs on board.

### Lee Gentry
Long, straight blond hair. Flies an unremarkable ship.
- **Chandler says:** He was imperious, headed to upper Sandusky to do a big deal for the Confederacy. Left 2–3 days ago (enough time to get to Upper Sandusky). Bought like 6 tanks of fuel. Crew was rowdy, probably still in town.
- **Boat:** the Chatelaine, similar style to ours, brilliant yellow with purple scroll work. 6 tanks fuel + 5 crew members definitely would not fit. Just the fuel, maybe.
